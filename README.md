# Running myPSDexplorer on binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/swnesbitt/bokeh-myPSD/master?urlpath=/proxy/5006/bokeh-app)

This repository runs the myPSD bokeh app, which enables interactive exploration of simulation of particle size distributions using `pytmatrix`. Thanks to Jussi Leinonen of MeteoSwiss for developing [pytmatrix](https://github.com/jleinonen/pytmatrix)!
   
When people click on the Binder link, they should be directed to the running Bokeh app.
